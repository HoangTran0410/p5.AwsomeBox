# ðŸ–± p5.AwsomeBox
**p5.AwsomeBox** is a [p5.js](http://p5js.org) library, update from [p5.clickable](https://github.com/Lartu/p5.clickable) that lets you create and customize buttons and assign event based behaviours to them. Plain speaking, with **p5.AwsomeBox** you can create buttons and define what happens when the user *hovers over*, *clicks*, *releases*, *drag* or moves their cursor *out* of them.

## Code Example
With **p5.AwsomeBox** and just a few lines of code you can get a button up and running. For example, to create a plain button at (20, 20) that when pressed changes color and shows an alert message you just do:
``` 
myButton = new AwsomeBox({          //Create button
    x: 20,
    y: 20
});
myButton.onPress = function(){      // When myButton is pressed
    this.fillColor = "#AAAAFF";     // Change button color
    alert("Yay!");                  // Show an alert message
}
```
Easy as pie!

## Live Example
[This example](https://hoangtran0410.github.io/p5.AwsomeBox/examples/basics) showcasts some of the main features of this library.
Its source code is available in the `examples` folder of this repository.

## How to Create a Button

**p5.AwsomeBox** provides the `AwsomeBox` class (aka, the buttons). To create a new button just instantiate a new AwsomeBox, like this:
```
myButton = new AwsomeBox();
```

The starting position of a Clickable defaults to (0, 0) and its size to (100, 50). You can create it at a different location:

```
myButton = new AwsomeBox({
    x: 200,
    y: 300
});
```

To move a AwsomeBox you can change its `x` and `y` properties:
```
myButton.x = 100;
myButton.y = 200;
```
or use the `locate` method:
```
myButton.locate(100, 200);
```

Likewise, to resize a Clickable you can modify its `width` and `height` properties:
```
myButton.width = 250;
myButton.height = 100;
```
or use the `resize` method:
```
myButton.resize(250, 100);
```

AwsomeBox also contain other properties that can be changed to alter their appearance:
```
// All value below is default value
myButton.fillColor = "#0000";       // Background color - default is transparent color
myButton.strokeColor = "#fff";      // Border color - default is white
myButton.strokeWeight = 1;          // Border width of myButton
myButton.cornerRadius = 0;          // Corner radius
myButton.draggable = true;          // If value is 'false', myButton can't be dragged

myButton.angle = 0;                 // Angle rotation of myButton
myButton.rotateSpeed = 0;           // Angle changing speed

myButton.text = "";                 // Text inside myButton
myButton.textFill = "#fff";         // Text color - default is inverted with fillColor
myButton.textStroke = "#0000";      // Text border color - default is transparent
myButton.textStrokeWeight = 0;      // Border width of text
myButton.textSize = 16;             // Size of text
myButton.textRotate = false;        // Text rotation - default is false

// With textRotate
// If value is 'true' - text rotate with button's angle
// If value is an angle (in radians) - text rotate with that angle value
```

Or you can do it shorter:
```
myButton = new AwsomeBox({
    x: 200,
    y: 300,
    width: 250,
    height: 100,
    fillColor: "#f00",
    strokeColor: "#000",
    cornerRadius: 100,
    draggable: false,
    rotateSpeed: radians(-1.5),
    text: "Awsome",
    textRotate: true
})
// All others properties (you not set) will have default value
```

To **run** a AwsomeBox, you have to use its `run` method. For example:
```
function draw(){
  myButton.run();
}
```
This is very important, for without this step your button will not be shown (nor work).

## Button Methods

AwsomeBox provide 5 methods that are called when the user interacts with the AwsomeBox in different ways.

**onOut** is called whenever the cursor is outside the area of the AwsomeBox.
```
myButton.onOut = function(){
  console.log("Hey! Cursor is out!");
}
```

**onHover** is called whenever the cursor is within the area of the AwsomeBox, but it's not being pressed:
```
myButton.onHover = function(){
  console.log("The cursor is over me!");
}
```

**onPress** is called when the user presses a AwsomeBox.
```
myButton.onPress = function(){
  console.log("I've been pressed!");
}
```

**onRelease** is called whenever the user clicks a AwsomeBox and then releases the click.
```
myButton.onRelease = function(){
  console.log("Bye bye!");
}
```

Finally, **onDrag** is called whenever the user clicks a AwsomeBox and then drag it around.
```
myButton.onDrag = function(){
  console.log("Dragging...");
}
```
